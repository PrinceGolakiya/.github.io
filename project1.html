            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The Hospital Management System project I completed at Sir Bhavsinhji Polytechnic Institute in 2021 likely involved developing software to manage various hospital functions, such as patient records, appointment scheduling, billing, and inventory management. This project had been aimed to streamline administrative tasks, improve data accuracy, and enhance the overall efficiency of hospital operations.</p>
            
            <!-- Key Features -->
            <div class="features">
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>Patient Management</h3>
                    <p>This feature allows for the efficient handling of patient data, including registration, appointment scheduling, medical history, diagnosis, treatment plans, and discharge details. It streamlines patient information management, ensuring quick access to records and reducing errors in data handling.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>Billing and Invoicing</h3>
                    <p>The system automates billing processes, including generating invoices, managing payments, and handling insurance claims. It integrates with various departments (like pharmacy, radiology, and pathology) to accurately track services provided, reducing the chances of manual errors and ensuring timely billing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature-item">
                    <h3>Inventory and Supply Chain Management</h3>
                    <p>This feature helps manage the inventory of medical supplies, equipment, and medications within the hospital. It tracks stock levels, generates alerts for low stock, and supports efficient procurement processes, ensuring the hospital has the necessary resources at all times.</p>
